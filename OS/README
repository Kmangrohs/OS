I'm currently 2 hours into the initial Kernal build. Setting up the VM with Fedora 20 proved challenging because I have an HP loatop.
I had to go into my VIOS settings as a gues, to set the BIOS admid password, then restart and login to BIOS as the admin and enable
virtualization. THen the changed wouldn't take effect until I pulled the battery out of my laptop... THanks stackoverflow
I'm considering removiing the 'make clean' option from the makefile in the Kernal source so that I don't have to do this full build again by accident..

I finally built the Kernel and am looking the fork.c source code. I found the commented line where max_threads/2 is being sent. I changed the line to  *95/100 instead of /2    which should set the number of max threads to 95% instead of 50%. 
At first I was scared to mess with the kernel source code. but after awhile of looking through fork.c I figured that thinking about it was only going to get me so far.. So I started to change values and recompile. I never did get the ulimit
-Ha command to display anything other than the below capture after any changes made, but Piazza and I are fairly certain that this is the correct line to alter. .patch file that I included will show the change to the source code that I made.
